# Predicting Trade Outcomes Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict trade outcomes (Trade Result) using three key features: **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**, **Volume Multiple**, and **Market Cap**. The repository explores various machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and interprets the results to provide actionable insights.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### **Stage 1: Data Filtering**
Analyze over 2,000 NSE-listed companies to identify stocks where the current day's trading volume exceeds four times the two-week average volume, leveraging data from Yahoo Finance.

### **Stage 2: Data Calculation and Backtesting**
- Calculate indicators such as RSI, volume multiple, and other relevant parameters.
- Store the results in a separate CSV file.
- Conduct backtesting to evaluate performance, including profit and loss outcomes.

### **Stage 3: Model Evaluation**
- Compare results using multiple machine learning models.
- Use RSI, volume multiple, and market capitalization as key features to predict trade outcomes.

### **Stage 4: Trade Prediction and Execution**
Deploy the best-performing model to:
- Predict the probability of profit for stocks meeting the predefined conditions.
- Execute trades based on the generated insights.

| XGBoost                | 0.5614   | 0.6030    | 0.7728 | 0.6774   | 0.5214  |
| Neural Networks (Tuned)| 0.6051   | 0.6093    | 0.9685 | 0.7516   | 0.5557  |
| Naive Bayes            | 0.4129   | 0.5805    | 0.0538 | 0.0984   | 0.5111  |
| SVM (Calibrated)       | 0.5956   | 0.5964    | 0.9941 | 0.7456   | 0.5113  |
| Voting Classifier      | 0.5909   | 0.5984    | 0.9532 | 0.7352   | 0.5398  |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Neural Networks outperformed other models after hyperparameter tuning.
- Logistic Regression, SVM, and Voting Classifier showed competitive results.
- Naive Bayes was unsuitable due to low recall and F1 score.

## üîç Feature Analysis

### **Feature Importance**
- **RSI**: The most significant predictor of trade outcomes.
- **Market Cap**: Strong influence with diminishing returns.
- **Volume Multiple**: Had a nonlinear effect.

### **Model Interpretability**
- **SHAP Analysis**:
  - RSI had a positive correlation with favorable trade results.
  - Market Cap showed a threshold effect beyond which impact plateaued.
- **Partial Dependence Plots**:
  - RSI exhibited a near-linear relationship with trade outcomes.
  - Volume Multiple had a complex impact pattern.
